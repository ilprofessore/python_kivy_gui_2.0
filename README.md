# Kivy Project OOP upgraded

i made the use of kivy design language in this project, again apk compiled using buildozer in ubuntu.
made use of multiscreens in this app; this app was more of a 'proof of concept' and doesn't have to serve a purpose.
i transferred stuff from one screen class to the second one by the use of global variables;
that might not be the best approach but it surely worked.
